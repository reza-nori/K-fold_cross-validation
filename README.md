# K-fold_cross-validation
Welcome to the K-Fold Cross-Validation repository! In machine learning and data analysis, the performance of a model on unseen data is of paramount importance. K-Fold Cross-Validation is a powerful technique that helps in assessing and improving the generalization performance of machine learning models.
This repository serves as a guide to understand and implement K-Fold Cross-Validation in your projects.
# What is K-Fold Cross-Validation?
K-Fold Cross-Validation is a resampling technique used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited dataset. It addresses the issue of model overfitting by partitioning the dataset into K subsets (or "folds"). The process involves training and evaluating the model K times, with each fold serving as the validation set while the remaining (K-1) folds are used for training.
# Why Use K-Fold Cross-Validation?
Better Assessment of Model Performance: K-Fold CV provides a more robust estimate of a model's performance by averaging the results over multiple iterations, reducing the impact of random fluctuations in a single train-test split.

Optimal Utilization of Data: In cases where the dataset is limited, K-Fold CV ensures that each data point is used for both training and validation at least once. This results in a more comprehensive evaluation.

Tuning Model Hyperparameters: K-Fold CV is commonly used for hyperparameter tuning. It helps in identifying the best combination of hyperparameters by comparing their performance across different folds.
